📍 Hamburg, Germany

Hello, world! My name is Caspar, aka CasCodes. I'm 17 years old.

Currently, I focus on Python to learn more about AI, in particular NLP (natural language processing). Teaching computers how to understand and generate human language is a fascinating field that has the potential to progress almost every industry.

In the future, I hope to solve meaningful problems with smart software.
